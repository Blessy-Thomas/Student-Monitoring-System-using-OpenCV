Installing and Configuring dlib:
We need to create an enivronment in order to install dlib, as it cannot be directly installed using pip. So, follow this commands in order to install dlib into your system if you haven't installed it previously. Make sure you have Anaconda installed, as we will be doing everyting in Anaconda Prompt. 
### Step 1: Update conda 
```bash
conda update conda
```
### Step 2: Update anaconda 
```bash
conda update anaconda 
```
### Step 3: Create a virtual environment
```bash 
conda create -n env_dlib 
```
### Step 4: Activate the virtual environment 
```bash 
conda activate env_dlib
```
### Step 5: Install dlib 
```bash 
conda install -c conda-forge dlib 
```
If all these steps are completed successfully, then dlib will be installed in the virtual environment <b>env_dlib</b>. Make sure to use this environment to run the entire project. 

### Step to deactivate the virtual environment 
```bash 
conda deactivate 
```

## Running the system: 

### Step 1: 
Clone the repository into your system by: 
```bash 
git clone https://github.com/fear-the-lord/Drowsiness-Detection.git
```
Or directly download the zip.
